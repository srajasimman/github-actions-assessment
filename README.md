# GitHub Actions Assessment Environment

## How This Solution Works

This setup provides a self-contained environment where candidates can write and test GitHub Actions workflows and JavaScript actions:

1. Docker Container: Creates an isolated environment with all necessary tools
2. VS Code Server: Provides a familiar IDE interface through the browser
3. [nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act): Allows testing workflows locally without GitHub infrastructure
4. Template Repository: Gives candidates a starting point with sample code

## Key Benefits

- Isolated: Candidates can experiment without affecting real infrastructure
- Complete: All tools needed for GitHub Actions development are included
- Realistic: Simulates real GitHub Actions behavior
- Accessible: Works in any browser, no special setup for candidates

## Assessment Distribution

You can share this environment with candidates through:

1. A hosted server with the Docker container (most secure)
2. Providing the Docker files for them to run locally
3. GitHub Codespaces with this configuration
